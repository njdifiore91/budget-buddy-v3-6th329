### 1.2 Security Threat Model

The Budget Management Application addresses the following key security threats:

| Threat | Mitigation Strategy |
|--------|---------------------|
| Unauthorized API Access | OAuth 2.0 authentication, API key protection, Secret Manager |
| Data Interception | TLS 1.2+ encryption for all communications |
| Credential Theft | No persistent storage of credentials, Secret Manager for secure storage |
| Financial Fraud | Transaction validation, amount limits, transfer confirmation |
| Data Exposure | Data masking, minimal data collection, secure logging |
| API Rate Limiting | Exponential backoff, circuit breaker pattern |
| Service Disruption | Retry mechanisms, fallback strategies, graceful degradation |

## 2. Authentication Framework

The application implements a comprehensive authentication framework to secure access to external APIs and protect sensitive operations.

### 2.1 Authentication Methods

| API | Authentication Method | Implementation Details |
|-----|----------------------|------------------------|
| Capital One API | OAuth 2.0 | Client credentials flow with refresh token mechanism |
| Google Sheets API | OAuth 2.0 | Service account authentication for backend services |
| Gemini API | API Key | Simple key-based authentication as per Google AI standards |
| Gmail API | OAuth 2.0 | Service account authentication with domain-wide delegation |

The `AuthenticationService` class centralizes all authentication logic, providing a consistent interface for obtaining and refreshing authentication tokens across different services.

### 2.2 Token Management

| Token Type | Storage Method | Refresh Mechanism | Expiration Handling |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| OAuth Access Tokens | In-memory only | Automatic refresh when expired | Exponential backoff on auth failures |
| API Keys | Secret Manager | Manual rotation | Graceful error handling |
| Refresh Tokens | Secret Manager | N/A | Alert on expiration |

**Token Caching:**

The application implements an in-memory token cache to minimize authentication requests:

```python
# Token cache implementation (simplified)
TOKEN_CACHE = {}
TOKEN_EXPIRY = {}

def is_token_expired(service_name):
    if service_name not in TOKEN_EXPIRY:
        return True
    return time.time() > TOKEN_EXPIRY[service_name]

def cache_token(service_name, token, expires_in):
    TOKEN_CACHE[service_name] = token
    TOKEN_EXPIRY[service_name] = time.time() + expires_in
```

### 2.3 Authentication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Budget App
    participant SM as Secret Manager
    participant Auth as OAuth Provider
    participant API as External API
    
    App->>SM: Retrieve credentials
    SM-->>App: Return secured credentials
    App->>Auth: Request access token
    Auth-->>App: Return access token + refresh token
    App->>API: Make API request with token
    
    alt Token Valid
        API-->>App: Return API response
    else Token Expired
        API-->>App: Return 401 Unauthorized
        App->>Auth: Request new token with refresh token
        Auth-->>App: Return new access token
        App->>API: Retry API request with new token
        API-->>App: Return API response
    end
```

The authentication flow includes automatic token refresh when expired tokens are detected, with exponential backoff for retry attempts to prevent API rate limiting issues.

### 2.4 Credential Storage

The application leverages Google Secret Manager for secure credential storage, providing:

1. **Automatic encryption** of stored secrets
2. **Version control** for credentials
3. **Fine-grained access control**
4. **Audit logging** of secret access

Credentials are never stored in code, configuration files, or logs. They are retrieved at runtime from Secret Manager and held in memory only for the duration needed.

## 3. Data Protection

The application implements comprehensive data protection measures to secure sensitive financial information throughout its lifecycle.

### 3.1 Encryption Standards

| Data Type | Encryption Method | Implementation |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| API Credentials | AES-256 | Google Secret Manager encryption |
| Data in Transit | TLS 1.2+ | HTTPS for all API communications |
| Sensitive Logs | Redaction | PII and financial data masking |

All communication with external APIs is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher, with certificate validation to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 3.2 Data Masking Rules

| Data Element | Masking Rule | Example |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Account Numbers | Last 4 digits only | XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234 |
| Transaction Amounts | No masking (required for functionality) | $123.45 |
| Transaction Locations | No masking (required for categorization) | "Grocery Store" |
| API Tokens | Full masking in logs | [REDACTED] |

**Implementation Example:**

```python
def mask_account_id(account_id):
    """Masks an account ID for secure logging"""
    if isinstance(account_id, str) and len(account_id) > 4:
        return 'X' * (len(account_id) - 4) + account_id[-4:]
    return '[INVALID_ACCOUNT_ID]'
```

### 3.3 Secure Logging

The application implements secure logging practices to prevent sensitive data exposure:

1. **Structured JSON logs** with consistent fields
2. **Sensitive data masking** before logging
3. **Appropriate log levels** to control verbosity
4. **Correlation IDs** to trace requests across components

**Example Log Format:**

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-07-23T12:01:15.123Z",
  "execution_id": "exec-2023-07-23-12-00-00",
  "component": "savings_automator",
  "operation": "transfer_funds",
  "status": "success",
  "details": {
    "amount": "45.67",
    "source_account": "xxxx1234",
    "destination_account": "xxxx5678",
    "transfer_id": "tr-98765"
  },
  "duration_ms": 1250,
  "severity": "INFO"
}
```

### 3.4 Data Minimization

The application follows data minimization principles:

1. **Collect only necessary data** required for functionality
2. **Process data for intended purpose** only
3. **Retain data only as long as needed**
4. **Delete temporary data** after processing

For example, transaction data is retrieved only for the past week, and only essential transaction details (location, amount, timestamp) are stored.

## 4. API Security

The application integrates with multiple external APIs and implements comprehensive security measures for these integrations.

### 4.1 API Authentication

Each API integration uses appropriate authentication mechanisms as detailed in section 2.1. The application implements the following additional security measures:

1. **Scoped permissions** to limit access to only required resources
2. **Token validation** before use
3. **Automatic token refresh** when expired
4. **Secure token storage** in memory only

**API Scope Requirements:**

| API | Required Scopes | Purpose |
|-----|----------------|----------|
| Capital One API | `transactions:read`, `accounts:read`, `transfers:write` | Transaction retrieval and savings transfers |
| Google Sheets API | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` | Read/write access to budget spreadsheets |
| Gemini API | Model access permissions | AI-powered categorization and insights |
| Gmail API | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send` | Send budget reports via email |

### 4.2 API Request Security

All API requests implement the following security measures:

1. **TLS encryption** for data in transit
2. **Request validation** before sending
3. **Response validation** after receiving
4. **Error handling** for security-related errors
5. **Rate limiting awareness** to prevent API abuse

**Example Secure API Request:**

```python
def get_transactions(self, start_date=None, end_date=None):
    """Retrieve transactions from the checking account for a date range"""
    try:
        if not start_date or not end_date:
            start_date, end_date = get_date_range()
            
        endpoint = f"{self.base_url}/accounts/{self.checking_account_id}/transactions"
        headers = self.get_auth_headers()
        params = {"startDate": start_date, "endDate": end_date}
        
        response = requests.get(endpoint, headers=headers, params=params)
        response.raise_for_status()
        
        return response.json()
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        return handle_api_error(e, "Capital One", "get_transactions")
```

### 4.3 Rate Limiting and Backoff

The application implements rate limiting awareness and backoff strategies to prevent API abuse:

1. **Exponential backoff** for retries
2. **Jitter** to prevent thundering herd problem
3. **Maximum retry limits** to prevent infinite loops
4. **Circuit breaker pattern** to prevent repeated calls to failing services

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[API Request] --> B{Rate Limited?}
    B -->|No| C[Process Response]
    B -->|Yes| D[Extract Rate Limit Headers]
    D --> E[Calculate Backoff Time]
    E --> F[Add Random Jitter]
    F --> G[Wait for Backoff Period]
    G --> H{Retry Count < Max?}
    H -->|Yes| A
    H -->|No| I[Log Rate Limit Failure]
    I --> J[Execute Fallback]
```

**Implementation Example:**

```python
@retry_with_backoff(requests.RequestException, max_retries=RETRY_SETTINGS['DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES'])
def get_transactions(self, start_date=None, end_date=None):
    # Implementation with automatic retry and backoff
```

### 4.4 Circuit Breaker Pattern

The application implements the circuit breaker pattern to prevent repeated calls to failing services:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed
    
    Closed --> Open: Failure threshold exceeded
    Open --> HalfOpen: Recovery timeout elapsed
    HalfOpen --> Closed: Successful request
    HalfOpen --> Open: Failed request
```

**Implementation:**

The `CircuitBreaker` class in `error_handling_service.py` provides a robust implementation of the circuit breaker pattern with configurable failure thresholds and recovery timeouts.

## 5. Financial Data Security

Given the application's focus on financial data, special attention is paid to securing financial operations.

### 5.1 Transaction Security

| Financial Operation | Security Measures | Validation Steps |
|--------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Transaction Retrieval | Read-only API access, Data validation | Verify transaction count and format |
| Savings Transfer | Amount validation, Transfer confirmation | Verify transfer receipt, Log confirmation |
| Budget Analysis | Data isolation, No persistent storage | Verify data cleanup after processing |

All financial operations implement comprehensive validation and verification to ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized or erroneous transactions.

### 5.2 Transfer Validation

The application implements multiple validation steps for savings transfers:

1. **Amount validation**:
   - Verify amount is positive
   - Verify amount is within transfer limits
   - Verify amount does not exceed available balance

2. **Account validation**:
   - Verify source and destination accounts exist
   - Verify accounts are active
   - Verify accounts belong to the user

3. **Transfer confirmation**:
   - Verify transfer was initiated successfully
   - Verify transfer completed successfully
   - Log transfer details with masked account information

### 5.3 Financial Transaction Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Budget App
    participant SM as Secret Manager
    participant CO as Capital One API
    
    App->>SM: Retrieve banking credentials
    SM-->>App: Return secured credentials
    App->>CO: Authenticate for transfer
    CO-->>App: Return auth token
    
    App->>App: Calculate transfer amount
    App->>App: Validate amount > 0
    App->>App: Validate amount <= surplus
    
    App->>CO: Verify account status
    CO-->>App: Return account info
    App->>App: Validate sufficient funds
    
    App->>CO: Initiate transfer
    CO-->>App: Return transfer ID
    
    App->>CO: Verify transfer completion
    CO-->>App: Return transfer status
    
    App->>App: Log transfer details (masked)
```

This secure flow ensures that all financial transactions are properly validated, executed, and verified.

## 6. Error Handling and Security
