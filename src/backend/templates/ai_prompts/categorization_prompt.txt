TRANSACTION LOCATIONS:
{transaction_locations}

VALID BUDGET CATEGORIES:
{budget_categories}

For each transaction location, respond with the location followed by the best matching category in this format:
"Location: [transaction location] -> Category: [matching category]"

If you're unsure about a category, choose the most likely one based on the transaction location. Every transaction must be assigned to exactly one category from the provided list.
